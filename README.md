### OVERVIEW
This project focuses on utilizing Power BI to enhance safety and healthcare infrastructure in metropolitan areas through data-driven insights. It begins with acquiring and preparing a healthcare infrastructure dataset. The next phase involves exploring and visualizing the data to uncover structures, distributions, and potential outliers. Also involves univariate and bivariate analyses, along with feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from the data.

#### Utilized Dataset:

The U.S. Census Bureau provides a comprehensive dataset capturing healthcare-related information for 83 different metropolitan areas across the United States. The dataset encompasses various metrics reflecting the healthcare landscape, physician demographics, hospital infrastructure, and the population's utilization of social security benefits.
